# Continue Here: Project Initialization

## Current State

Mid-way through `/gsd:new-project` command. Codebase has been mapped, now in questioning phase.

## Completed

- [x] Codebase mapping (`.planning/codebase/` with 7 documents)
- [x] Git repo verified
- [x] Brownfield detection passed (codebase map exists)
- [x] Entered questioning phase

## Not Yet Created

- [ ] PROJECT.md
- [ ] config.json
- [ ] REQUIREMENTS.md
- [ ] ROADMAP.md
- [ ] STATE.md

## Context

This is a **brownfield project** — an existing Next.js 16 portfolio website with:

**What exists:**
- Home page with hero section
- Projects showcase (3 demos: Board Race, Asteroids, Tic-Tac-Toe)
- Contact page with Motion.so booking
- Private dashboard behind Google OAuth
- PythonTerminal, CodeViewer, ProjectDemo components

**Known concerns (from CONCERNS.md):**
- Metadata still shows "Create Next App" placeholder
- About page is placeholder content
- Private dashboard has placeholder content
- No test coverage

## Next Action

Resume with `/gsd:new-project` to continue questioning:

> "What are you looking to build next? What's missing or incomplete that you want to focus on?"

The user needs to answer what they want to add/improve before we can create PROJECT.md.

## Resume Command

```
/gsd:new-project
```

Or if you want to start fresh with full context:

```
/gsd:resume-work
```
